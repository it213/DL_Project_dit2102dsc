Required libraries:

 pytorch version          --> 1.12.0+cu102
 matplotlib version       --> 3.5.2
 tqdm version             --> 4.64.0
 IPython version          --> 8.4.0
 Jupyter notebook version --> 6.4.12

Instructions to run the code:

- Run the scripts in the 'Deep_Learning_Project.ipynb' in the order they appear in that ipynb file.
- Change the path names to the files and folders in accordance to your filesystem.
- Be careful with the 'Abstract_gallery/Abstract_gallery/class' subfolder. Retain that hierarchy of folders, as changes could result in malfunctions caused by the ImageFolder modules.
- Using the whole dataset (~2700 images) will work and provide better results, however it is not a recommended action when having low resources. In order to use the whole dataset, place all the images in the 'Abstract_gallery/Abstract_gallery/class' subfolder.
-As the whole dataset is very large (more than 700MB), it is not provided in this paper. However, it can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery
